# lebergarrett.com - Frontend

This repo holds the frontend code for my personal website, created as part of the cloud resume challenge located at <https://cloudresumechallenge.dev>

Most of the interesting stuff is in the backend repo <https://github.com/lebergarrett/lebergarrett.com-backend>

I chose to use a template for the website found at w3schools.com.

The javascript counter was crafted by myself using a fetch request to the API built by the backend.

Github Actions automatically deploys updates to this repo to the live S3 bucket hosting the site.
